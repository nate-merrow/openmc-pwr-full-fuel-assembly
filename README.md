# Overview

I created this project to enhance my ability to work with OpenMC's geometry to create full fuel arrays.
This project simulates a full 17 x 17 PWR assembly using enriched UO2 fuel.
The outputs of this project currently consist of the tallies.out file that contains the UO2 fuel tallies, flux tallies, and reaction rates for the fuel, 
as well as a plot of the geometry.

# What Next?

I may attempt a adding depletion to this project in order to more accuately simulate a reactor's behavior over time.
I may also try creating a mini or full core lattice with multiple of these assmblies in a more complex lattice.
